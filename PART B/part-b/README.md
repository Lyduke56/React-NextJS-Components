React/NextJS Components â€“ Part B
A simple demo app showcasing basic React/NextJS component creation and usage.

Components Overview
    â€¢ ðŸš€ WelcomeCard
    Displays a short welcome message. Currently set to display the developerâ€™s name (me :3).

    â€¢ â˜• Counter
    An interactive counter that asks, "How many coffees have you had today?" Just a fun way to experiment with React state.

    â€¢ ðŸŽ“ StudentInfo
    A simple form that collects your:
        â€¢ Name
        â€¢ Age
        â€¢ College course

Designed to practice working with user input and state updates hence the simplicity.

NOTE: Feel free to ignore some comments that don't seem that relevant as I made those as notes intended for future projects.
