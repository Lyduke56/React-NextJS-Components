JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part A: Simple To-Do List
A simple To-Do List App created to showcase core JavaScript Fundamentals, including:
    â€¢ Variables, functions, arrays, and objects
    â€¢ DOM manipulation exercises
    â€¢ Event handling basics

Features Overview
    â€¢ âž• Add Tasks â€“ Create and display new to-do items.

    â€¢ ðŸ§¹ Clear All Tasks â€“ Instantly remove all tasks from the list.

    â€¢ âœ… Clear Finished Tasks â€“ Remove only the completed ones.

    â€¢ ðŸ’¾ Data Persistence â€“ Tasks are stored in local storage using JSON, so your list stays intact on reload.

Designed to be a learning exercise to strengthen understanding of basic JavaScript as I am still very new to the language.

NOTE: Feel free to ignore some comments that don't seem that relevant as I made those as notes intended for future projects.
